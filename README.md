# IOT

Using Arduino UNO, Raspberry PI, breadboard, sensor, beeper and cables, created a system of RGB which flashes red, blue and green light depending on the distance of an obstruction from the sensor. 
If an object is at less than 10m from the sensor then red light glows and the beeper starts beeping.
If the object is at a distance greater then 10m and less than 20m, blue light glows with no beeping sound.
If the object is at a distance greater than 20m then green light glows with no beeping sound.
